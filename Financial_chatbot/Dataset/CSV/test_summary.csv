Apple Inc. (AAPL) has reported its quarterly results for the period ended July 1, 2017. The company's revenue grew by 17% year-over-year to $45.4 billion, driven by strong sales of iPhones and Macs. Gross margin expanded by 50 basis points to 38.2%, while operating expenses increased by 15%. Net income rose by 21% to $8.7 billion, resulting in diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.42.

The company's iPhone segment accounted for 54% of total revenue, with sales increasing by 14% year-over-year. Mac sales grew by 11%, while iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories segments saw declines of 21% and 15%, respectively.

Apple's cash and marketable securities balance stood at $261 billion as of July 1, 2017, representing a 10% increase from the previous quarter. The company generated $12.5 billion in operating cash flow during the quarter.
